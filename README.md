## Getting Started

This Project implements a cli TODO list in java 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> This project is made in  ` visual studio code ` so the ` .vscode ` is important for the project to be able to run sucessfully 

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
